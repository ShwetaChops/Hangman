# Hangman

Tricky version of the game Hangman where the Computer proceeds by changing the word to be guessed, minimizing the probability of User finding success with each guess.

Implemented as a one user vs. computer game where the user attempts to guess the word selected by the computer in the least number of guesses possible.

Main method may be found in the Controller class.
